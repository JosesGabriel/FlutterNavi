## Flutter Development

A document that contains **Flutter**, **Dart**, **Material Design**, and **Mobile Development** articles, standards, examples, and any reference that I find useful while learning Flutter.

## Flutter

- Best reference is always [Flutter's API Documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/). Find out more about a Widget's information (constructor, methods, etc.) by pasting the Widget name into the search bar.
  
- [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev) for Flutter Development.

- [Open source](https://github.com/bernaferrari/FigmaToCode) [Figma to Flutter converter](https://github.com/bernaferrari/FigmaToCode) made by **u/bernaferrari**. Haven't personally used but may be useful for designers. 
  
- [Medium article](https://medium.com/py-bits/turn-any-color-to-material-color-for-flutter-d8e8e037a837) about creating a custom Material Color (Primary Swatch) from any color.

## Material Design

- [Official Material Design website](https://material.io/)

- [An article](https://material.io/design/material-studies/shrine.html#product-architecture) about a retail app that uses Material Design components and Material Theming to express branding for a variety of fashion and lifestyle items. They break down the architecture and show how Material Design is utilized in the platform. Hosted at the official Material documentation site. Informative read.
