## Flutter Development

A document that contains **Flutter**, **Dart**, **Material Design**, and **Mobile Development** articles, standards, examples, and any reference that I find useful while learning Flutter.

## Flutter

- Best reference is always [Flutter's API Documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/). Find out more about a Widget's information (constructor, methods, etc.) by pasting the Widget name into the search bar.

- [Collection of sample apps](https://flutter.github.io/samples) created by the Flutter Dev Team. Good for dissecting methodologies within the context of an actual app.

- [Official Flutter Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/flutterdev). Contains Keynote talks, and a series called 'Widget of the Week' where they give a summary about what a Widget does and how it works.
  
- [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev) for Flutter Development.

- [Open source](https://github.com/bernaferrari/FigmaToCode) [Figma to Flutter converter](https://github.com/bernaferrari/FigmaToCode) made by **u/bernaferrari**. Haven't personally used but may be useful for designers. 
  
- [Medium article](https://medium.com/py-bits/turn-any-color-to-material-color-for-flutter-d8e8e037a837) about creating a custom Material Color (Primary Swatch) from any color.

- [Demo](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/BlendMode-class.html) of the different `BlendModes` in Flutter. Use together with the `ColorFiltered` Widget to apply color filters to any Widget.


## Mobile Design

### General 
___

- [UPLabs](https://www.uplabs.com/) & [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/following/mobile) for finding design inspirations.

### Material
___

- [Official Material Design website](https://material.io/)

- [An article](https://material.io/design/material-studies/shrine.html#product-architecture) about a retail app that uses Material Design components and Material Theming to express branding for a variety of fashion and lifestyle items. They break down the architecture and show how Material Design is utilized within the application. Hosted at the official Material documentation site. Informative read.
